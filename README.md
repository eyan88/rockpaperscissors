# Rock Paper Scissors

## Reflection
The purpose of this project was to learn JavaScript and HTML/CSS. It initially required a console-only version of Rock-Paper-Scissors and was only later that the GUI was implemented. The most challenging part of this project was getting familiar with the Document-Object-Model and all the syntax associated with it. The site itself is not anything intricate, just a simple GUI to familiarize with JavaScript and DOM, however I do plan on adding to it to make it more like a game and less like a project.

I can definitely work on cleaning up the code so that it is much easier to follow and really get familiar with navigating the DOM.
